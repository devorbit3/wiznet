<h1>A Complete Guide to CCTV Security for Homes and Offices</h1>

<p>CCTV security is an important part of modern protection for both homes and offices. People want safer spaces where property, staff, families, and visitors can remain secure. CCTV systems allow users to observe activities and understand what happens around their buildings, providing a reliable way to record events. As security concerns continue to grow, it becomes more important for property owners to understand how CCTV security works and how it can be used for daily protection.</p>

<h2>What CCTV Security Means</h2>
<p>CCTV, or closed-circuit television, refers to a system where video signals are captured and sent to specific monitors or recording devices. The footage is not broadcast publicly. This structure allows property owners to maintain privacy while still monitoring important areas.</p>

<h2>Main Purpose of CCTV Security</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Monitor property areas in real time</li>
    <li>Record activities for review when needed</li>
    <li>Prevent theft, damage, and unauthorized entry</li>
    <li>Support investigations after incidents</li>
    <li>Increase safety and confidence for residents and employees</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Homes Use CCTV Systems</h2>
<h3>Benefits for Residential Security</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Watch main gates, doors, and windows</li>
    <li>Monitor children and elderly residents</li>
    <li>Observe suspicious movement outside</li>
    <li>Check deliveries and guests</li>
    <li>Provide evidence in case of theft</li>
</ul>

<p>Homes without security are more likely to face risks. Recorded footage also helps settle neighborhood disputes if property damage occurs.</p>

<h2>Why Offices Use CCTV Systems</h2>
<h3>Benefits for Office Safety</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Monitor staff and visitor activity</li>
    <li>Reduce internal theft and property misuse</li>

</ul>

<h2>Components of a CCTV System</h2>
<h3>Key Components</h3>
<ul>
